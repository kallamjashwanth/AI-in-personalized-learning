Math,Algebra,"# Algebra  

**What is Algebra?**  
Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols, variables, and letters to represent numbers and relationships. It provides a way to generalize arithmetic and solve problems systematically.  

**Core Elements:**  
1. **Variables** – symbols (x, y, z) representing unknown values.  
2. **Constants** – fixed numbers.  
3. **Expressions** – combinations of constants, variables, and operators.  
4. **Equations** – statements where two expressions are equal.  

**Examples:**  
- Solve: 3x + 7 = 16 → x = 3.  
- Simplify: (2x + 3) + (4x − 5) = 6x − 2.
